**UPD 201406**: After 4 years http://python.org finally got an issue tracker at https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues




This is my personal tracker for `*`.python.org wannabes and other community services that couldn't find a place on python.org for political reasons.

## Why external tracker? ##
`*`.python.org has several trackers maintained by volunteers. These are:
  * bugs.python.org  - for bugs in Python interpreter and standard library
  * TBD

There is no tracker for wiki, web-site and other `misc` stuff of `python.org` [software farm](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Inventory), because maintaining additional RoundUp instances [incurs additional overhead](http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/issue340) which current volunteers can not afford.

Nowadays no real collaboration is possible on the Internet with no tracker at all, so there was a need to use something, and here is it.

## Why Google Code? ##
It was the most simple one to setup and tune (while being quite powerful at the same time). There should be a feature comparison somewhere, but I couldn't find the time to work this out.

## What is it for? ##
For [everything](http://code.google.com/p/pydotorg/issues/list) related to python.org services. It is a point of reference for keeping requests, bugs and proposals in one place that may also become a shared playground for developing these services. Stars can be used to mark more important features. Labels to separate ideas around python.org web-site, wiki, design, and user stories.

## Goals ##
  1. Encourage creating useful tools for Python development outside of python.org domain
  1. Create open collaboration platform for new services and cross-issues that don't fit other trackers
  1. Make Python development process less restrictive and time consuming. Free core developers from needless routines and let them concentrate on those part of Python that need more attention to help it be an awesome tool
  1. Help people spot important issues and self-organize around them into teams
  1. Promote healthful cooperation with upstream projects, involve upstream maintainers
  1. Share the results, attract more people, and have fun

## Epilogue ##

Google Code can hardly be a universal collaborative platform, but it is a good starting point to organize issues, ideas and enhancements (an addition to Wiki pages for [site](http://wiki.python.org/moin/SiteImprovements) and [tracker](http://wiki.python.org/moin/DesiredTrackerFeatures)) that can make the process more fun and engaging.

## License ##
Preferred license is MIT as there is no less restrictive license on Google Code.

## History ##
It started in April 2010..

..and stopped in May 2010

This tracker was opened in November 2010 when it became obvious that Python development community needs a tracker to self-organize.

As of November 2012 it appears to be a personal tracker of a single person as it appears nobody else is interested in tracker coordination point for pydotorg improvements.
