GitHub tracker for Python community services. It is a point of reference for keeping ideas, bugs and tasks in one place that is easy to grep for hackatons and sprints. This is a temporary solution until services on *.python.org become more convenient to use than GitHub. The backlog here allows more people to work on Python services in parallel with official channels.

* web site - http://python.org/ - https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/
* wiki - https://wiki.python.org/moin/ - https://github.com/pydotorg/backlog/labels/Wiki
* bugtracker - https://bugs.python.org - https://wiki.python.org/moin/TrackerDevelopment

#### Why GitHub?

Collaboration and synchronization on Python wiki and proposed services such as http://login.python.org/ is hard. Official way assumes email-based communication model and specification-driven (waterfall) language development. But there should be a place with greater freedom for experiments with alternative approaches.

It is possible to install RoundUp, but it needs some work before people will be able to use and enhance it. Moving it to `[ ]` Jinja2, which requires moving to `utf-8` as internal encoding, `[ ]` adding OpenID Connect as standard feature.

#### What is it good for?

* [ ] vote on the features (not sure it has stars concept like Google Code)
* [x] select stuff to work on
* [x] coordinate during sprints
* [x] separate and cross-reference ideas between python.org web-site, wiki, etc.
* [ ] provide place for design, art, user stories and other things that don't fit anywhere else

#### Goals
  1. Encourage creating useful tools for Python development outside of python.org domain
  1. Create open collaboration platform for new services and cross-issues that don't fit other trackers
  1. Make Python development process less restrictive and time consuming. Free core developers from needless routines and let them concentrate on those part of Python that need more attention to help it be an awesome tool
  1. Help people spot important issues and self-organize around them into teams
  1. Promote healthful cooperation with upstream projects, involve upstream maintainers
  1. Share the results, attract more people, and have fun

#### Crediting vs Licensing



#### History

It started in April 2010..
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/pydotorg-www/2010-April/thread.html

..and stopped in May 2010
http://richleland.bitbucket.org/pydotorg-pm/index.html
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/pydotorg-www/2010-May/000386.html

..opened tracker on Google Code in November 2010
http://code.google.com/p/pydotorg

..on November 2012 it appeared that involvement and participation is low

..on June 2014 python.org got new a site and GitHub tracker
https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/

..April 2015 Google Code service is being shutdown, migrated to GitHub
repositioned the tracker to be more open and less dependent on single person
